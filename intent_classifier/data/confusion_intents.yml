  examples:
    - wait what?
    - huh?
    - There is nothing here
    - Oh wait, what?
    - I don't know
    - I'm so lost right now
    - wait I don't get it
    - what's going on?
    - hold on, what?
    - um... I'm not following
    - I'm kinda confused
    - what are we doing again?
    - sorry, I'm a bit lost
    - hang on, I'm confused
    - I can't figure it out
    - What is that?
    - How that affects it?
    - I have no idea what's happening
    - wait, can you say that again?
    - I'm not sure what we're doing
    - what do you mean by that?
    - I'm totally blanking
    - wait, how does this work?
    - I'm not really getting this
    - what are we supposed to do?
    - um... what?
    - can someone explain what's going on?
    - I think I'm missing something
    - hold up, I'm lost
    - this isn't making sense to me
    - are we supposed to know this?
    - I'm kind of stuck here
    - wait, where are we?
    - how does this even work?
    - I'm not following at all
    - How do we solve this problem?
    - Where can I find this?
    - Which method should we use here?
    - Can you explain the steps again?
    - What does this symbol mean?
    - Where should we start?
    - What's the difference between these?
    - How do these parts connect?
    - What are the key components?
    - What happens if we change this variable?
    - How does this relate to the previous topic?
    - What tools do we need for this?
    - Why do we use this method?
    - What's the purpose?
    - How will this be applied?
    - What are the requirements for this task?
    - Can you explain why?
    - Changes, why?
    - What, all of a sudden?
    - What was that?
    - Is that the task?
    - That changed, why?
    - What happened?
    - What did you do?
    - Where did you get that?
    - Well, what was that instruction?
    - Then what?
    - Did it take something to write?
    - What's the matter?
    - How does that affect it?
    - Should we go straight or go somewhere?
    - But is it the same?
    - If its not the same then what can we say about it?
    - Is there more?

- intent: certainty
  examples:
    - I know
    - I am sure it's there
    - It's going to be that
    - That is why it's changing
    - Put this here and that there
    - This is definitely correct
    - I know exactly how to do this
    - I've got this figured out
    - There's no doubt in my mind
    - I'm certain this is the right answer
    - I understand this perfectly
    - This makes complete sense to me
    - I'm confident in my solution
    - I know this like the back of my hand
    - This is exactly right
    - I've mastered this concept
    - I can explain this to anyone
    - I'm 100% sure about this
    - This is crystal clear to me
    - I've got a solid understanding of this
    - There's no question about it
    - I know what I'm doing here
    - This is absolutely correct
    - I'm positive this is right
    - I've got this down pat
    - This is definitely the way to do it
    - I understand this thoroughly
    - I'm completely sure about this
    - This is undoubtedly correct
    - about 13 meters per second at its maximum.
    - You're such a loser.

- intent: neutral_statement
  examples:
    - Yes
    - No
    - Oh my god
    - This?
    - It is random
    - That is the same
    - It stays the same
    - It changes
    - I mean, it's not like that
    - There is nothing here
    - It is the same
    - It is not the same
    - No need for this
    - How much?
    - It can't be too late
    - I'm sorry about that
    - Bitterness
    - That isn't gonna stay in place enough
    - Alright, let's see what happens
    - I'm not going to
    - We should continue with the next part
    - Let's look at this example
    - I'm working on it now
    - That's what we discussed earlier
    - We covered this last week
    - The answer is in the textbook
    - I'll check my notes
    - But if that is gone, we can do that
    - it's not really that way when it is changing 
    - This reminds me of something
    - We're almost finished
    - Do you want to do this?
    - Would you like that?
    - What else?
    - That's interesting, isn't it?
    - You might be onto something there, right?
    - Wouldn't that be the same as before?
    - I suppose that could work?
    - That's just how it is, isn't it?
    - What's the formula for this equation?
    - When is the assignment due?
    - Can you show an example?
    - Maybe we should try another approach?
    - I'm just thinking out loud here
    - The weather is nice today
    - We need to submit this soon
    - I'll get started on this
    - That's what the book says
    - Let's move on to the next topic
    - I wrote down the main points
    - We can discuss this later
    - The class is almost over
    - I brought my materials
    - This seems familiar
    - That's what I thought too
    - We're making progress
    - The deadline is approaching
    - I'll review this at home
    - That's a different perspective, right?
    - Shouldn't we consider all options?
    - Wonder if that makes a difference?
    - Could be worth trying, don't you think?
    - That's just how science works, isn't it?
    - The answer might be simpler than we think?
    - I'm just following the instructions
    - We'll finish this tomorrow
    - The group project is coming along
    - I've added my part to the presentation
    - Let's take a short break
    - The experiment is running
    - We should document our findings
    - That's what the data shows
    - I'm taking notes
    - The results are interesting
    - We're on schedule
    - This matches our hypothesis
    - The procedure is straightforward
    - That's what we predicted
    - I'm still on the wrong question.
    - There's nothing in here.
    - Now I'm not getting this skater off tonight.
    - Not here, not here.
    - we'll see how it changes.
    - There's these white dots...
    - What's the matter?
    - Is it here?
    - I'm not going to lie.
    - To the left of the box
    - Let's put it down, put it in there
    - Hey, don't be so confused
    - because then it will happen again
    - Well, it wasn't...
    - That is not what happens
